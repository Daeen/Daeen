 ### I'm Daeen Kabir.

I'm an aspiring machine learning engineer and researcher, with keen interest in language and vision-related tasks, transformers and associated multi-modal architectures.

I also have hands-on implementation background in deep learning architecture and machine learning pipelines, and extensive knowledge on many deep learning methods.

I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate student of computer science (major) and electrical engineering (minor) in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).
